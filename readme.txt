The command palette that gives super fast access to your WordPress Dashboard.

== Description ==

## The command palette that gives super fast access to your WordPress Dashboard.

Ugh, this Dashboard menu is so cluttered?

Where is everything?

Is it in Tools? Or Settings? Or some menu of it's own?

How am I supposed to work with this clutter?

## If the WordPress Dashboard is slowing you down, Turbo Admin is here to speed you up.

A simple key-combination launches a command palette with all your menu items.

Fuzzy search helps you find items even when you're not sure what they are called.

If you've used AlfredApp or Spotlight or the command palette in your text editor or IDE, you'll know the benefits of a tool like this and you'll quickly feel at home.

Install... activate... work faster!

## How does it work?

Install the plugin and activate it and then press Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P (or Cmd-Alt-Shift-P on a Mac) to open the palette.

You can:
 - type to filter the commands
 - use up and down arrows to select an item
 - press enter to select an item
 - hit escape (no too hard) to close the palette

## I'd love it if...

Yeah, yeah, I know. This is a first version. I'll be letting you change the key combination and adding other new features soon.

## Do I really have to install this on EVERY site?

It's funny you ask. I'm working on a browser extension that will let you have a command palette on every wp-admin without
having to install anything!

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install this is to:

1. Search for it on the plugin directory
2. Install it
3. Activate it

If you're reading this then you've probably already done step 1. So what are you waiting for?
